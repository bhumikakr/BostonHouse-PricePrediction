# BostonHouse-PricePrediction



- In this project, I applied basic machine learning concepts (linear regression) on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.
- I first used the NumPy,Pandas,seaborn libary to analyze the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset and visualize it. 
- Next, I split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. I analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. 
- Finally, I tested this model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to my statistics. 
- The result was obtained.
