# BostonHouse-PricePrediction

- In this project, I applied basic machine learning concepts (linear regression) on the data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.
- I first used the NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn libary to analyze and visualize the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. 
- Next, I split the data into testing and training subsets, and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem. I analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. 
- Finally, I tested this model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to my statistics. 
- The result was obtained.


# Using Linear Regression:
```
Model Score: 73.7% Accuracy
Training Accuracy: 74.7% Accuracy
Testing Accuracy: 72.2% Accuracy
```

# Using Random Forest Regressor:
```
Training Accuracy: 99.99% Accuracy.
Testing Accuracy: 99.94% Accuracy
```
# Summary:

From the Exploratory Data Analysis, we could generate insight from the data. How each of the features relates to the target. Also, it can be seen from the evaluation of the models that Random Forest Regressor performed better than Linear Regression.
