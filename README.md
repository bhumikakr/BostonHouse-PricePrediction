# BostonHouse-PricePrediction



- In this project, I applied basic machine learning concepts (linear regression) on the data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.
- I first used the NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn libary to analyze and visualize the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. 
- Next, I split the data into testing and training subsets, and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem. I analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. 
- Finally, I tested this model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to my statistics. 
- The result was obtained.
